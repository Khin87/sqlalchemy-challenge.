# sqlalchemy-challenge.

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decided to do a climate analysis about the area using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic data exploration and analysis of an SQLite climate database. All analysis is done using SQLAlchemy (ORM queries), Pandas, and Matplotlib. It also provides an API (designed using Flask) for querying this climate data.

Part I: Exploratory Climate Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, set up base, create classes for each table, and connect to the sqlite database.

It also supports the planning of visits to Hawaii with:
  local precipitation summaries for each of the local weather stations and
  temperature dailies for a flexible range of trip dates.
  
Part II: Design Climate App
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design a Flask API based on the queries that were developed during the climate analysis.
